			<h1>CARS</h1>
			<p>
				Aspiring champion race car Lightning McQueen is on the fast track to
				success, fame, and everything he's ever hoped for—until he takes an
				unexpected detour on dusty Route 66. His have-it-all-now attitude is
				thrown into a tailspin when a small-town community that time forgot
				shows McQueen what he's been missing in his high-octane life.

			<h1>CHARACTER DESIGN</h1>
			<img src="images/character_head.jpeg" alt="Characters of Cars" />
			<h2>Cars as Characters</h2>
			<p>
				The filmmakers wanted the cars to look and feel authentic, so that the
				audience would relate to them as characters. A hotshot racecar was the
				early choice for lead character Lightning McQueen, and a rusty real-life
				tow truck found off Route 66 came to life as Mater. The Pixar team chose
				other cars to reflect people they had met on the road during their
				research for the film.

			<h3>Lightning McQueen</h3>
			<p>
				Lightning McQueen is a hotshot, rookie race car, poised to become the
				youngest car ever to win the Piston Cup Championship. He has just two
				things on his mind: winning and the perks that come with it. But when he
				in-advertently gets lost in the town of Radiator Springs, he meets a new
				group of friends who challenge him to reconsider the car he wants to be.

			<h3>Mater</h3>
			<p>
				Mater is a good ol' boy tow truck with a big heart and a lovable laugh
				to match. Though a little rusty, he has the quickest towrope in
				Carburetor County and is always the first to lend a helping hand. He's
				the sweetest, most loyal guy in town and the first to befriend newcomer
				Lightning McQueen.

			<h3>Sally</h3>
			<p>
				Sally is a beautiful 2002 Porsche 911 from California who grew tired of
				life in the fast lane and made a new start in the small town of Radiator
				Springs. Charming, intelligent, and witty, she is the town's attorney
				and the car most dedicated to one day getting Radiator Springs "back on
				the map."

			<h3>Doc Hudson</h3>
			<p>
				Doc Hudson is a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a quiet country doctor with a
				mysterious past. A cornerstone of Radiator Springs, Doc runs the local
				medical clinic and serves as the town judge. But when Lightning McQueen
				rolls through town, Doc's old competitive engine gets revved up once
				more.

			<h1>WORLD DESIGN</h1>
			<img src="images/world_head.jpg" alt="The world of Cars" />

			<h2>Route 66</h2>
			<p>
				With a cast made entirely of cars, the world of Cars required a lot of
				road. Fast-track motor speedways would provide some of the pavement, but
				the story needed a sleepier locale. The filmmakers found it on Route 66,
				the fabled highway where American car culture took off in the 1950s.
				When the highway was replaced by the federal interstate system, hundreds
				of towns virtually fell off the map.
			</p>

			<h2>Radiator Springs</h2>
			<p>
				Memorable research trips along Route 66 led the Pixar team to create the
				town of Radiator Springs in a high desert setting somewhere between
				Gallup, New Mexico, and Kingman, Arizona, where towns of broken neon,
				peeling paint, and colorful denizens still exist. “We connected with the
				people and their towns and we really got it,” Co-Director and Story
				Supervisor Joe Ranft observed. “We found out that life out on that old
				highway is never predictable, and that is what makes the journey so much
				more memorable. We found the heartbeat of the Mother Road.”
