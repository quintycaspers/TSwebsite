					Aspiring champion race car Lightning McQueen is on the fast track to
					success, fame, and everything he's ever hoped for—until he takes an
					unexpected detour on dusty Route 66. His have-it-all-now attitude is
					thrown into a tailspin when a small-town community that time forgot
					shows McQueen what he's been missing in his high-octane life.

			<h1>CHARACTER DESIGN</h1>

			<section>
				<h2>Cars as Characters</h2>
				<p>
					The filmmakers wanted the cars to look and feel authentic, so that the
					audience would relate to them as characters. A hotshot racecar was the
					early choice for lead character Lightning McQueen, and a rusty
					real-life tow truck found off Route 66 came to life as Mater. The
					Pixar team chose other cars to reflect people they had met on the road
					during their research for the film.

				<h3>Lightning McQueen</h3>
				<p>
					Lightning McQueen is a hotshot, rookie race car, poised to become the
					youngest car ever to win the Piston Cup Championship. He has just two
					things on his mind: winning and the perks that come with it. But when
					he in-advertently gets lost in the town of Radiator Springs, he meets
					a new group of friends who challenge him to reconsider the car he
					wants to be.

			<h1>WORLD DESIGN</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Route 66</h2>
				<p>
					With a cast made entirely of cars, the world of Cars required a lot of
					road. Fast-track motor speedways would provide some of the pavement,
					but the story needed a sleepier locale. The filmmakers found it on
					Route 66, the fabled highway where American car culture took off in
					the 1950s. When the highway was replaced by the federal interstate
					system, hundreds of towns virtually fell off the map.
				</p>

				<h2>Radiator Springs</h2>
				<p>
					Memorable research trips along Route 66 led the Pixar team to create
					the town of Radiator Springs in a high desert setting somewhere
					between Gallup, New Mexico, and Kingman, Arizona, where towns of
					broken neon, peeling paint, and colorful denizens still exist. “We
					connected with the people and their towns and we really got it,”
					Co-Director and Story Supervisor Joe Ranft observed. “We found out
					that life out on that old highway is never predictable, and that is
					what makes the journey so much more memorable. We found the heartbeat
					of the Mother Road.”
